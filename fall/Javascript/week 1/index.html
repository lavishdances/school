      In Pseudocode:
      1) Que orders and fullfill them:
      Steps:
      1. intake orders ( 5 )
      let arr = [4]
      2. logic ( if orders is less than 5 but more than 0 then itterate through untill order is completed )
      if arr > 0 && < 4 then:
      3.Once completed delete or pop that specific order and keep iterating through untill all 5 are complete
      arr.pop()
      2) Reservation system
      have/create a database
      have cunsumer fill out form ( is it hourly, daily, etc.)
      ask when the reservation is done to store the data in database 
      3) sort these items alphabetical name and shoes
       have some way of sorting by alphabet perhaps with built in .sort() function
