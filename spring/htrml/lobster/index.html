       <dd>Smooth and creamy, our Lobster Bisque is always a crowd pleaser and has never been easier!</dd>
        <dd>Using lobster tails guarantees a rich and decadent bisque that cooks in under one hour.</dd>
        <dd>Traditionally, lobster bisque is made with a stock made of whole lobster shells.
          </dd>
            <dd>
              Our version is much easier and just as robust, with a simple stock, aromatics, spices and simple ingredients!

        <h2>How To Make Lobster Bisque</h2>
        <hr>
        <dd>
          The secret is to build those flavours slowly, starting with a homemade lobster stock.
        </dd>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
            BOIL lobster tails, shells and meat in salted water for only 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <dd>
                This way, we pre-cook the meat and get as much lobster flavours as we can.
            </dd>
            <hr>
            <li>COOL SLIGHTLY AND REMOVE meat out of the shells using either of the two methods below:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Place lobster tail on your counter with the back facing up. Using sharp kitchen shears, cut down through the centre of the back to the end of the tail. With your thumbs and fingers, open the shell to loosen it from the meat, opening the meat away from the shell side walls. Pull the meat up from the bottom of the shell to seperate the shell from the meat underneath it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternatively, use both hands to press down on tail to crack shell. Hold tail, shell facing down, and pull back on both sides of shell to crack open and remove meat.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

            CHOP into bite-sized pieces and refrigerate while boiling the empty shells for a further 15 minutes. Keep that stock to add into the bisque later.

<h2>   what is lobster bisque made of?</h2>
<hr>
        <dl>
           <dd>
             Once you have your quick stock, start making the base for the soup with a beautiful mirepoix, onion, carrot, and celery.
             </dd>
             <dd>
                You'll see a mirepoix in most of our recipes, like Chicken Noodle Soup, Homemade Sausage Rolls and Creamy Ham Potato Soup, for maximum flavour benefits.
             </dd>
             <dd>  Sautae with fresh herbs in a blend of oil and butter to sweat and release their flavours before adding garlic, cayenne pepper (for an optional bit of heat) and the rest of your ingredients.</dd>

       <h2>how do you thicken lobster bisque?</h2>
       <hr>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            Tomato paste and hint of flour help to thicken your soup.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Cook the flour for a couple of minutes first before adding liquids.

            The pot gets deglazed with a dry white wine.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Use a good quality Pinot Grigio, Sauv Blanc or Chardonnay, one that you would drink!
            </dd>
            <dd>
            If you can't drink it, you shouldn't cook with it.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            You can replace the wine with sherry if you prefer!
            </dd>
            <dd>
            Sherry is a fortified wine that adds a delicious, savoury kick to your soup, similar to our Creamy Chicken Marsala.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Let reduce to half, then stir in your pre-made lobster stock and let simmer until liquid has thickened.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              It only takes about 30 minutes to get those delicious flavours to marry into each other.

          Puree right in the pot with an immersion blender OR pour into a blender.
          </dd>
          <dd>
          If using a blender, you may need to blend in batches of two or three to prevent pressure from building up inside the jug from the heat.
          </dd>
          <dd>
          Make sure you take the centre piece out of the lid to let the steam escape.

        <dd>
          You want your bisque to be nice and smooth.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Then, pour it back into your pot, stir in the heavy cream and chunks of lobster.
        </dd>
    <dd>
      Garnish with fresh tarragon, chives or sliced green onions.

          Frozen or canned lobster meat can be used BUT fresh is best. I cannot guarantee the flavour in your bisque will turn out the same.

        Both options are a great substitution for this recipe.
