<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Step Zeroâ€¦<br>This part deals with style sheets, css and layout. So I assume you already have completed <strong>Part 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Your site must use the following link convention:<br><b>http://10.17.1.119/your-name/caferacer/ </b></p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps:</h3>
<p>1) Final versions of the site will use a link to a single stylesheet located: /style/style.css</p>
<p>2) No css styles in the header. Only the external link. I would suggest that you either use a dev server like XAMPP or begin working with embedded styles and copy them from one page to the next as you develop the site. You should end up with a single place for all the styles. You can then copy everything to style.css and then erase all the styles on the HTML pages.</p>
<p>3) you will be evaluated for creating the website as it is specified here in this document. I am giving you a little wiggle room but this is not a place to show me your interpretations. Save that for your summer projects. Try to follow the screenshots as closely as you can.</p>
<p>4) The Following are <a href="caferacer%20screenshots.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots (pdf)</a>. I will be happy to print them for you in color if that helps you work. These are your guides. I will also provide graph paper to anyone who needs it to develop the layout code.</p>
<p>5) Here are a collection of CSS styles to use in your site. These have been annotated, you might want to do the same for your own work. <a href="style-parts.css" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style-parts.css</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="caferacer%202.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caferacer 2.zip</a> with all of the above and notes on Google Fonts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This project is due by the end of Friday May 12th.</strong></p></body></html>
